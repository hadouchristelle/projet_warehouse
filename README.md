# projet_warehouse
Building  data warehouse with Sql server, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics.

##Project Requirements
This project implemented a three-layer data warehouse pipeline (Bronze, Silver, Gold) using SQL Server.
Data from folder file CRM and ERP systems was ingested  into the Bronze layer, cleaned and standardized in the Silver layer, and transformed into star-schema models in the Gold layer.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
